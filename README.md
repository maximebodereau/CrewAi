# CREWAI experiments

------ 

For my experiments with CrewAI, I decided to try 3 different projects, starting from the easiest to the most complex. The aim of the experiments was to have a team of AI agents do following work for me:
1. Examine my Startup idea
2. Build AI newsletter with Google SERP
3. Build AI newsletter with Reddit Scraper 
4. Email classifier [WIP]

## For my experiements I've tried following LLMs:
---

### Available through API calls:

1. Ollama

### Local Models through Ollama + rating of how they performed:

1. **Mistral 7B** 
- Nice, coherent results
- Didn't understand that it should use scraping tool for the output
- Result is a bunch of generic text from training data
